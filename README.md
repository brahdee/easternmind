# Eastern Mind
A photo gallery website made using Django + Tailwind CSS.

A live demo is not currently available, but photography of my own is included so that it can be tested locally:

(make sure to create a db.sqlite3 and config.ini file in the `easternmind` directory)

## Running manually:
`cd easternmind`

`poetry run python3 manage.py runserver`

## Running with docker:
`docker-compose build`

`docker-compose up`
